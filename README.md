 ## Recommendations
 
Robinhood should offer services like insurance services and tax services to allow for its growth and expansion. Tax services enable the company to identify clients evading taxes, which further affects its financial plan (Sun, Chuanen). Insurance services allow the company to compensate customers in case of loss and protect the company's corporate image. The kind of technologies adapted in insurance services uses information from social media to aid in risk assessment and chatbots to help in exchanging ideas. Tax services will adopt artificial intelligence as a tool for ensuring tax compliance. Robinhood Company should implement such services to enhance rapid growth and customer satisfaction.
